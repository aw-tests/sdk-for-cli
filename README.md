Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the Command Line SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools.

## Installation

The Appwrite CLI is a Node based command line tool to help you interact with the Appwrite API. The CLI is distributed both as an [`npm package`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appwrite-cli) as well as [pre built binaries](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli/releases/latest) for specific operating systems and architectures.

### Install using NPM

If you have `npm` installed, it's as easy as running

```sh
$ npm install -g appwrite-cli
```

Once the installation is complete, you can verify the install using

```sh

### Install using prebuilt binaries
